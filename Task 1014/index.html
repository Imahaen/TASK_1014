                <h2>Welcome back dear friend</h2>
                <p>Lockdown round three, and almost a year since we went into the first, it’s quite incredible to think of what has passed in the last 12 months. 
                Schools closed, shops shut, banned from seeing friends and family and restrictions placed on our freedoms, freedoms that prior to this we just accepted as a given that we had. 
                On the flip side, we can also admit to finding joy in some of the facets of lockdown – not constantly rushing around, a slower pace and enjoying the simplest of things in life 
                are all elements that we could look to retain when we come out of this.Time for a personal reset?</p>

                    <p>We’ve all started a new week with fresh healthy eating goals, which by Wednesday have fallen by the wayside – and if that sounds like you, you’re not alone.
                    Clear intentions and goals are very important when it comes to setting out long-term healthy eating habits, and if you start by outlining targets that are too vague, or too restrictive, you could be at risk of plans failing right from the outset.

                    <p>After one dad transformed his health and fitness from an overweight and stressed city worker to a health coach, he is working to help others do the same.
                    Darren Kirby is a wellbeing coach and founder of Fitter Healthier Dad and says that losing weight, getting fitter and having more energy is not as complicated or time-consuming as most of us think. His career as a fitness expert follows his own transformation six years ago from an overweight, stressed-out city worker, who lost 61lbs, to now helping countless dads break through the barriers and improve their health through his advice and unique programmes.
